                Hi, I’m Allison Yeh! I am majoring in Informatics and minoring in Statistics at UC Irvine. I’m passionate about 
                leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create impactful software. 
                With experience in programming (Java, Python, JavaScript), data analysis, AI/ML, 
                and UI/UX, I thrive on developing innovative solutions that drive results. 
                Through class projects, I’ve gained experience creating user-friendly interfaces, 
                while my research in data and machine learning has focused on solving real-world 
                challenges in healthcare. Additionally, I’ve worked as a data analyst for a startup,
                where I applied data insights to support decision-making. I'm currently looking for 
                internship roles that can leverage my coursework and experience.
                <br>
                <br> In my free time, I love playing badminton, photography, video editing, and 
                playing the ukulele.
