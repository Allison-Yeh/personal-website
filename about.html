                I’m a UC Irvine undergraduate student with a strong interest in UI/UX design, data analysis, 
                and machine learning. Through class projects, I’ve gained experience creating 
                user-friendly interfaces, while my research in data and ML has focused on solving
                real-world challenges in healthcare. Additionally, I’ve worked as a data analyst for a startup,
                where I applied data insights to support decision-making. I’m eager to apply my
                skills across various industries and gain more hands-on experience in design,
                data, and AI. Let’s connect and explore potential opportunities!
